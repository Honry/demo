<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This test checks that the video tracks of
MediaStream object returned by the success callback in getUserMedia are
correctly set into inactive state when permission is revoked.
</p>

<h2>Preconditions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Use a test device with depth camera(embedded or external).
  </li>
  <li>
    When prompted, accept to share your depth stream, and then revoke that permission.
  </li>
</ol>

      assert_equals(vidTrack.readyState, "ended", "Video track has been ended as expected");
      assert_false(stream.active, "MediaStream has been inactive as expected");
      t.done();
    }, 5000);

  });// longer timeout since requires user interaction
